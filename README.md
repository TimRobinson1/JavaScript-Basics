JavaScript Basics
=================
This repository is about learning the fundamentals of JavaScript. Initially, it was
simply FizzBuzz, but this was later expanded to cover the Airport Challenge.
The Airport Challenge was the first weekend challenge for the Makers Academy course,
and was first written in Ruby.  That version can be found [here](https://github.com/TimRobinson1/airport_challenge).

FizzBuzz:
-------
The basic structure of FizzBuzz makes it an excellent starting point for attempting
to understand a new language through test driven development.  See [here](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/FizzBuzz) for more.

Airport Challenge:
-------
The Airport Challenge is a good exercise for getting to grips with how a language deals
with objects, functions and their interactions.  It is also a useful starting point
for attempting to test for what is usually a random element.
